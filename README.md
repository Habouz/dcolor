#DColor: A Domain Coloring Python Module
##What is DColor?
DColor is a Python module for visualizing complex-valued functions using [Domain Coloring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_coloring). Often, there is a desire to "see" what a complex-valued function looks like in order to gain some intuition about it. Unfortunately, living in a 3-dimensional world, we lack access to an extra (fourth) dimension to be able to do this. The solution implemented here is to color the *domain* of a complex-valued function in as described below.
